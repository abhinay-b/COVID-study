# COVID-study
Contains my study on COVID in India.

The jupyter notebook contains a comparative study of COVID cases across states in India.

Live data is fetched from <a href="https://api.covid19india.org/">here</a> and histograms, donut charts are drawn to give a visualization of the live situation across various states in India. Further, few states are selected and a finer analysis of COVID cases across districts in those states are done through histograms. 

Dependecies:
1. Histogram notebook: 
    1. python
    2. Jupyter notebook
    3. requests module (pip install)

  Run all the cells to fetch live data and plot the results.
